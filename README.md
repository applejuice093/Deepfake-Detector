# 🕵️ DeepFake Detection Tool

An AI-powered web application that detects **deepfake content** across **images, videos, and audio**.  
The system uses a **custom-trained deep learning model** exposed via a **FastAPI backend**, with a lightweight web-based frontend for real-time analysis.

## 🤗 Hugging Face Space (Live Demo)

A live, interactive demo of the **DeepFake Detection Tool** is hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**, allowing users to test the model directly from the browser without local setup.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Image DeepFake Detection  
- 🎥 Video DeepFake Detection  
- 🎧 Audio DeepFake Detection  
- ⚡ FastAPI-based backend  
- 🌐 Web frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
- ☁️ Cloud deployment (Hugging Face)  
- 🔐 Secure API-key based access

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads an image, video, or audio file
2. Frontend sends the file to the FastAPI backend
3. Backend processes the input using a trained AI model
4. The model analyzes deepfake artifacts and inconsistencies
5. Result is returned as **Real/Fake** with a confidence score
